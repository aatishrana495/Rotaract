			<h2> Blood Donation Camp </h2><p align="justify">
                    
				 Every year, we organise a blood donation camp in our institute association with NITRAA and Red Cross. 
				 In October 2016,the event was inaugurated by the director of the institute and our faculty advisor Mrs. Sushmita Das.
				 Our main motto is to invite and make people and the students volunteer for a good cause. In todayâ€™s society there is always need of blood. But in hospitals finding blood of different blood group is a concern so our main aim was to make this event a success and to collect as much blood from the people as possible.
				The Redcross team included professional doctors who carefully checked and analyzed the health condition and necessary criterions so that there will be no fault in the donation of blood and the health of the individuals. All the people who had arrived at the camp were registered carefully by analyzing their blood group and then were called systematically for the donation. The blood packets were properly labeled by the Red Cross members and then it was sent to the blood bank.
				 All the people who attended the blood donation camp were provided with refreshments and a proper seating place to rest. The donators were later provided with the official donation certificate and a donorâ€™s card, which contained the donation history of the donor and it also gives them priority in getting blood from the red cross in case of an emergency.
				 The event was a huge success as the count of people who volunteered to donate their blood cross 150. The donators involved large number of students of our college, staff members and even some people from outside our institute who show interest in donating their blood for a good cause.

				<h2> Birsa Munda Vidhyapeeth</h2>                        
                  <p align="justify">      Birsa munda vidhyapeeth is a government aided school where local children who live nearby come to attain and grasp as much knowledge as they can. The school consists of various class divisions and is taught a variety of subjects by the local teachers and individuals. 
                        The members of Rotaract club go to Birsa Munda Vidhyapeeth every Saturday to share their knowledge and teach the children with their best capabilities to provide as much as we can for the students so that they can atleast learn from every small bit and could implement them to widen their knowledge.<br>
                        Birsa Munda Vidhyapeeth was also a project area for our â€œCleanliness and Awarenessâ€ campaign, where we taught the students the benefits of keeping themselves and the environment around them clean and hygienic. We showed then students the proper ways of washing hands along with the benefits of washing hands once in awhile. 
                        We donated a large number of soaps to the school so that the students get motivated to start a new habit by which they can stay healthy and fit and also told them to share the importance of washing hands and staying clean among their friends and family so that everyoneâ€™s health remains stable and hygienic.<br>
                        We also went around the slum area where we sweeped the roads and poured phenyl in the open drains and sewage. We also went to many homes and told the people how we should always keep our surrounding clean and we distributed soaps and phenyl bottles to them.
                        At the end we provided the students, staff members and teachers with refreshments and ended the campaign.
