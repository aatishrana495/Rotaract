			<h2> Rotary International </h2>
                      <p align="justify">&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is a global community of committed professionals working together to serve others and advance peace.
More than 1.2 million members in over 34,000 Rotary clubs worldwide volunteer in communities at home and abroad.
Individual Rotary clubs sponsor Rotaract clubs and offer guidance and support, making the Rotaract club true â€˜partners in serviceâ€™ and key members of the family of Rotary.<br>
<h4>Objectives:</h4>
  <ol><li>The development of acquaintance as an opportunity for service.</li>
 <li>High ethical standards in business and professions; the recognition of the worthiness of all useful occupations; and the dignifying of each Rotarianâ€™s occupation as an opportunity to serve society.</li>
 <li> The application of the ideal of service in each Rotarianâ€™s personal, business, and community life.
 <li>The advancement of international understanding, goodwill, and peace through a world fellowship of business and professional persons united in the ideal of service.
Rotary is dedicated to six areas of focus to build international relationships, improve lives and create a better world to support our peace efforts and end polio forever. These include:
 <li>Promoting peace:</li><p align="justify">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Rotary encourages conversations to foster understanding within and across cultures. We train adults and young leaders to prevent and mediate conflict and help refugees who have fled dangerous areas.</p>
 <li>Fighting disease:</li><p align="justify">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We educate and equip communities to stop the spread of life-threatening diseases like polio, HIV/AIDS, and malaria. We improve   and expand access to low-cost and free health care in developing areas.</p>
 <li>Providing clean water, Sanitation, and Hygiene:</li>
<p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We support local solutions to bring clean water, sanitation, and hygiene to more people every day. We donâ€™t just build wells and walk away. We share our expertise with community leaders and educators to make sure our projects succeed long-term.</p>
 <li>Saving mothers and children:</li>
<p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Nearly 6 million children under the age of five die each year because of malnutrition, poor health care, and inadequate sanitation. We expand access to quality care, so mothers and their children can live and grow stronger.</li><p>
 <li>Supporting education:</li><p align="justify">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp More than 775 million people over the age of 15 are illiterate. Our goal is to strengthen the capacity of communities to support basic education and literacy, reduce gender disparity in education, and increase adult literacy.</li><p>
 <li>Growing local economies:</li><p align="justify">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We carry out service projects that enhance economic and community development and create opportunities for decent and productive work for young and old. We also strengthen local entrepreneurs and community leaders, particularly women, in impoverished communities.Ending polio forever
Rotary has been working to eradicate polio for over 30 years, and our goal of ridding the earth of this disease is in sight. We started in 1979 with vaccinations for 6 million children in the Philippines. Today, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan are the only countries</ol> </p>

				<h2> Rotary Club </h2>
                      <p align="justify">&nbsp &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Rotaract (which stands for Rotary in Action) is a Rotary-sponsored service club for young men and women (ages 18 to 30). Rotaract clubs are either community or university based, and theyâ€™re sponsored by a local Rotary club. This makes them true "partners in service". The first Rotaract club was the Rotaract Club of North Charlotte in North Carolina, founded on March 13, 1968. Since then, Rotaract has grown into one of Rotary's most significant and fastest-growing service programs, with more than 9,723 clubs in about 170 countries and geographical areas comprised of over 207,690 members.

<h3>What is Rotaract?</h3>
Rotaract clubs are part of a global effort to bring peace and international understanding to the world. This effort starts at the community level but knows no limits in its outreach. Rotaractors have access to the many resources of Rotary International (RI) and The Rotary Foundation. Rotary International provides the administrative support that helps Rotaract clubs thrive.

<h4>Structure of Rotaract</h4>
Rotaract is divided into districts around the world. These districts follow the Rotary-structured districts. At the district level, the District Rotaract Representative serves as the leader and representative of all clubs in their respective district to Rotary International.
Each Rotaract club itself is structured differently. The Standard Club Constitution states that there is a president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer, with additional officers provided in the by-laws.

<h4>Objectives of Rotaract</h4>
<ol><li>To develop professional and leadership skills</li>
<li>To emphasize respect for the rights of others, based on recognition of the worth of each individual</li>
<li>To recognize the dignity and value of all useful occupations as opportunities to serve</li>
<li>To recognize, practice, and promote ethical standards as leadership qualities and vocational responsibilities</li>
<li>To develop knowledge and understanding of the needs, problems, and opportunities in the community and worldwide</li>
<li>To provide opportunities for personal and group activities to serve the community and promote international understanding and goodwill toward all people</li>
</ol>
