			<h2>CLOTH COLLECTION DRIVE</h2>
                              <p align="justify">
                        Every year we organize a cloth collection drive in which we approach students, professors and other staff members of our institute to donate as much wearable clothes as possible.
                        Many of us have more than what we really need. In India, itâ€™s a common tradition to give old clothes, leftover food, old notebooks, boxes etc to domestic helps. There are so many other needy families that can benefit from our old things.
                        We sort collected clothes into childrenâ€™s clothes, adult female, adult male and misc (misc may have blankets, socks, bed sheets etc) or you may sort according to what different NGOs have asked for or according to seasons.
                        Collected clothes are being donated to Shanti Bhawan and Birsa Munda School.

           </p>

			<h2> BLANKET DONATION CAMP</h2>  <p align="justify">


                      <ol>  <li> Money collected from the money raising events like Housie and V-day are used for buying new blankets for poor.</li>
                        <li> We buy new blankets from the funds.</li>
                        <li>We donate the blankets to the poor sleeping at the roadside and near Rourkela railway station.</li>
                        <li> In the freezing night, when the entire Rourkela city dons their sweaters, monkey caps, mufflers with a hot cup of tea, there are few under-previleged who cannot afford even a blanket and die- without a roof or clothes on their bare bodies.</li>
                        <li> Itâ€™s not about changing the lives of the people but doing something even more basic than that-making them survive-enabling them to fight their battle of survival against mother nature.</li>
                      </ol>
                </p>
			<h2>Kalyan</h2>
				<p align="justify">
                        Kalyan is an event which held an interschool competition for different events in which students from various schools in Rourkela had participated. It was heart warming to see even the differently abled students taking interest and taking part in the event. This show the dedication and hardwork of the students and that they nothing can stop them from atleast trying their best. 
                        The event also included drawing and singing competitions from the children. Various organizations and clubs had been invited to the event and donations were also made to different schools. 
                        Proper lunch were served to all the delicate guests and the students who had shown interest to take part in the event and to everyone who had contributed to make the event a success.
